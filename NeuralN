        <h1>Neural Networks and Deep Learning</h1>
        <p>Neural networks are a class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes, called neurons, that process input data to produce an output. The power of neural networks comes from their ability to learn complex patterns from data.</p>

        <h2>What is Deep Learning?</h2>
        <p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on neural networks with many layers. These deep neural networks can model complex, high-level abstractions in data, making them particularly powerful for tasks such as image and speech recognition.</p>

        <h2>Example of a Neural Network Model</h2>
        <p>Below is an example of a simple neural network model built using Python's <code>TensorFlow</code> and <code>Keras</code> libraries. This model is designed to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.</p>

        <pre><code class="code">
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Load the MNIST dataset
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Normalize the images
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

# Build the neural network model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.2),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)

# Evaluate the model
model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
        </code></pre>

        <h2>How Neural Networks Work</h2>
        <p>Each neuron in a neural network takes input from several other neurons, processes it, and passes it on to the next layer. The connections between neurons have weights that are adjusted during training to minimize error. This process is what enables the network to learn from data.</p>

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Deep_Learning.jpg" alt="Deep Learning Diagram">

        <p>Deep neural networks can have dozens or even hundreds of layers, allowing them to learn extremely complex representations of data. This makes them very effective for tasks like image classification, natural language processing, and more.</p>
